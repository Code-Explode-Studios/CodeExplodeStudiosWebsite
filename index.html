            The Back Rooms - No Escape is a slow-burning psychological horror experience that traps players in an 
            ever-expanding maze of eerily familiar, yet deeply wrong, environments. Set in the uncanny no-man’s-land 
            between reality and dream logic, the game pulls you into a place that feels just like somewhere you've been 
            but where something has gone terribly, irreversibly off.
            You’ll explore miles of empty office halls, flickering hotel corridors, damp storage rooms, and liminal spaces
            that loop and warp in impossible ways. Nothing is explained. Nothing is safe. And something is watching.
            There are no enemies you can see just the constant pressure of something hunting you, something feeding off 
            your confusion, your stillness, your fear. As you descend deeper, the spaces grow more hostile, more surreal, 
            more personal. You’re not just lost physically the game starts pulling at your memories, your perception, 
            your sense of time. You’ll second-guess yourself constantly, and that’s exactly what it wants.
            The Back Rooms - No Escape is about the fear of the ordinary turned inside out. It’s the dread of being alone
            in a place that shouldn’t exist. A survival experience not built on combat or monsters, but pure atmosphere, 
            psychological tension, and the terrifying realization that there is no way out.

            Charlie’s Rage Stage is a raw, high-pressure VR experience set in the unforgiving glare of modern reality television and internet spectacle. Players are thrown headfirst into a live, televised arena where every move is judged, every word dissected, and the chaos of today’s society plays out in real time. The game captures the intensity of a world obsessed with outrage, viral moments, and public meltdowns  and puts you at the center of it.

            You’ll face off against other volatile contestants in a ruthless, unscripted social battlefield filled with fake smiles, explosive arguments, unexpected betrayals, and crowd-fueled hysteria. Every encounter is designed to test your ability to perform under pressure while managing the volatile emotional landscape around you. The audience a massive, reactive digital crowd responds dynamically to your behavior, cheering your wins or turning on you with terrifying speed.

            This isn’t a game about combat, it’s a game about survival in the court of public opinion. You’ll navigate everything from staged interviews and influencer drama to viral sabotage campaigns and emotional breakdowns. No two playthroughs are the same, and the chaos only escalates the longer you last.

            Charlie’s Rage Stage is a searing commentary on our culture of performance and exposure a brutal mirror to the world of internet fame, where the spotlight can make you a star or destroy you overnight.

            Due to unforeseen challenges and the ambitious scope of the project, development on <strong>Ash Vegas</strong> has been temporarily placed on hold. With current resources focused on completing several smaller titles, we’ve made the difficult decision to pause production for the time being. However, we remain fully committed to revisiting Ash Vegas in the future, once our development schedule clears and the team is better equipped to bring the project to life as originally envisioned.
